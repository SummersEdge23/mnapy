Circuit Solver Python Engine

As I approached my senior year for my B.S. in Electrical Engineering, I wanted to create something that most people
hadn't created before, a circuit simulator! It was about the experience, the learning, and the the journey itself. I put
together this application to package my knowledge in Electrical Engineering to some day help another student have an
easier time in their scholastic pursuits and in turn teach them about circuits. Circuit Solver is far from perfect and
there are lots of things that could be optimized. It will however, simulate a majority of linear Circuits and a decent
amount of smaller scale Non-Linear Circuits. If this app helps you in any way, i'd appreciate you spreading the word to
help support my efforts Thanks!

Think of Circuit Solver as an electronic circuit board, you drag your electrical components and place them on one at a
time. You hook up some sources and you place some meters to read the values. If you need to analyze the waveform, grab
some electrical leads and view them with an oscilloscope. There are many SPICE tools out there for PC such as Multisim,
LTSpice, and PSpice. Circuit Solver doesn't compare to their raw power but it is optimized to run on mobile devices
which makes it both portable and easily accessible to anyone in need of circuit solutions. Circuit Solver strives to
verify Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws by creating models that are both stable and efficient.

DC Simulation: To solve the circuits, a matrix is defined based on all the components inside the circuit. The
application solves the circuit using matrix manipulations such as LU-Decomposition and matrix inversion. DC Analysis is
completed by writing a series of nodal equations. The equations are solved simultaneously to obtain a unique solution.

Transient Simulation: In transient simulation we use numerical integration to determine the response of RLC circuits.
Numerical integration allows for one to solve for discrete moments of time and in effect integrate their response. This
application only supports the Backward Euler Method.

Non Linear Simulation: Non linear analysis is used for components such as diodes and LEDs. The solver first guesses the
approximate value of the solution and is refined through the use of a Newton-Raphson process. It utilizes linear
approximation to predict the answer through successive iterations.

Built-in-Oscilloscope: Visualize waveforms through the use of the built in oscilloscope. To use this feature simply link
either a volt meter or an amp meter to the graph by tapping on them and pressing the eye, in order to view the wave.

Saving Schematics/Circuits: Save your circuits on your device to use anywhere you go and at any time. You may also
capture screen shots of the circuits you build. These screen shots are saved locally on your device.

DISCLAIMER:
-----------------------------------------------------------
Circuit Solver is developed to make sure it's capable of generating
correct simulation results should the user understand that it's a fixed timestep
solver. PhasorSystems is not liable for any incorrect simulation results.

NOTE: This is only tested w/ file version 1.1.9 and above. There is no gurantee
that it will work for older files.

This engine will allow you to run the simulation engine for circuit solver
without a user interface. It will also allow you to edit parameters when
the simulation is running and in turn do dynamic simulations such as battery
models, buck or boost converters, etc.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Tested On:
-----------------------------------------------------------
Python 3.8.5

-----------------------------------------------------------
Setup:
-----------------------------------------------------------
Note: The demo requires numpy and pandas to work correctly.

pip install mnapy

To get the test files nagivate to: 
https://github.com/SummersEdge23/mnapy/tree/main/test

Download "ACSourceInitial_nl.txt" and "TestBed.py"

Change the FILE_LOCATION in TestBed.py to match where ever your "ACSourceInitial_nl.txt" is located. 
Run Testbed.py. If everything goes well a window should open up with a
waveform that should look like an acsource.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Generating New Files:
-----------------------------------------------------------
In order to load new files into the system, go to www.androidcircuitsolver.com/app.html
or use the desktop version (windows only atm). Build your circuit and
in order to port this to the headless version press: CTRL + P.
This will generate a {FILE_NAME}_nl.txt file that can be loaded into this
headless engine.

Note: Set_Switch_State(setter: str) and Set_Interpolate(setter: str)
can be set by:

Set_Switch_State(engine.Params.SystemConstants.ON) or
Set_Switch_State(engine.Params.SystemConstants.OFF)

if (Get_Switch_State() == engine.Params.SystemConstants.ON) or
if (Get_Switch_State() == engine.Params.SystemConstants.OFF)

The same thing applies for Interpolate.
